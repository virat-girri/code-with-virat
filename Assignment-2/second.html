    The short answer is Yes! Every person lives by a code. The real question is what is your code? How would you sum up in a few words your philosophy about life, how you define and hold yourself, and how you treat others?

    Your life code is much greater than just having a moral code, 
    and yet your life code does include having a moral and ethical set of principles, not just because of your culture or religion, but moreover for the larger purpose of humanity and nature.
    
    A life code is about life and the way you want to live it. It determines what defines you, the values you want to work toward and what you will base your decisions on. The other day I was driving past and I saw this person with a young boy.
     He was standing outside a cigarette shop and was offering the boy some pan masala (a mixture of betel leaves, tobacco, and lime, which is very injurious to health.) While he may be just fooling around,
     he has inadvertently spiked the curiosity in the child to have that mixture. Why,
     because a close member of his family is having it and is actually offering it to him.
